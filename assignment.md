If you decide to go with Option 2, [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A02_9D5_sbLyrjnaDDiOEUvDY5qzKGJt?usp=sharing) includes the 5 datasets you can choose from. They are also all linked below. 

#### I) FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015: 
This is a cleaned table of wildlife strikes from 2000-2015 in the United States. Visit the FAA Wildlife Strike Database which contains records of wildlife strikes reported by airlines, airports, pilots, and other sources. The dataset is available here as [faa_data_subset.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V-tOmmtGtiY_3XMnYtVblDhlj_kzLBxa/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108445376648788204707&rtpof=true&sd=true.)

Follow the steps below:

1. Connect your data
2. Detect different data types in your data
3. Build at least 5 different visualizations to learn more about the dataset
4. There are three main different categorical features in the table. Try to learn more about these categories and find appropriate numerical features to study different trends. 
  - Effect 
  - When
  - Wildlife
5. In your final project you should show visualizations with:
  - Maps
  - Date and time
  - Analytical visuals (Forecasting - Clustering)
  - Show Me tables
6. Try to find an interesting pattern, trend, outlier, etc. from the data used in the above steps.
7. From step 5, try to detect meaningful keypoints. This is the starting point to think about your dashboard. 
8. Now that you are familiar with your dataset and your columns, in this step, come up with different questions which you will be answering and presenting at the end of this project
9. Create the dashboard to answer your questions that you came up with in step 8 and try to revise your questions along the way.
10. Get ready to present your dashboard 




#### III) AIRBNB:

This table contains 30,478 Airbnb listings in New York City. This data was compiled from Inside Airbnb. The dataset is available here as [airbnb.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BJWyZpZrrRUla_EQ6Pnusy0KH31UMGf2/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108445376648788204707&rtpof=true&sd=true).

Follow the steps below:

1. Connect your data
2. Detect different data types in your data
3. Build at least 5 different visualizations to learn more about the dataset. 
4. There are three main different categorical features in the table. Try to learn more about these categories and find appropriate numerical features to study different trends in them. 
  - Room Type 
  - Beds
  - Price
  - Neighbourhood
  - Host Since
5. In your final project presentation, you should show visualizations with:
  - Maps
  - Date and time
  - Analytical visuals (Forecasting - Clustering)
  - Show Me tables
6. Try to find an interesting pattern, trend, outlier, etc. from the data used in the above steps.

9. Create the dashboard to answer your questions that you came up with in step 8 and try to revise your questions along the way.
10. Get ready to present your dashboard 


#### IV) Tuberculosis Burden by Country:

The World Health Organization estimates the prevalence and mortality of Tuberculosis by country. The dataset is available here as [TD_Burden_Country.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mRvMbGLzeYKCuELODUhbLYSXM-n6fbQ_/view?usp=sharing).

1. Connect your data
2. Detect different data types in your data
3. Build at least 5 different visualizations to learn more about the dataset. 
4. This table has 47 different features. Can you detect the most important features ? Why do you think these are important? Can you define a question for yourself? Try to learn more about these categories and find appropriate numerical features to study different trends in them. 
  - For example , the following features could be important for your analysis:
    - Country or territory name
    - Year
    - Estimated total population number
    - Estimated prevalence of TB (all forms) per 100 000 population
    - Estimated prevalence of TB (all forms)
    - Method to derive prevalence estimates
    - Estimated number of deaths from TB (all forms, excluding HIV)
    - Method to derive mortality estimates
    - Case detection rate (all forms), percent
5. In your final project you should show visualizations with:
  - Maps
  - Date and time
  - Analytical visuals (Forecasting - Clustering)
  - Show Me tables
6. Try to find an interesting pattern, trend, outlier, etc. from the data used in the above steps.
7. From step 5, try to detect meaningful keypoints. This is the starting point to think about your dashboard. 
8. Now that you are familiar with your dataset and your columns, in this step, come up with different questions which you will be answering and presenting at the end of this project.
9. Create the dashboard to answer your questions that you came up with in step 8 and try to revise your questions along the way.
10. Get ready to present your dashboard. 


#### V) Causes of Death - Our World In Data: 

The Global Burden of Disease is a major global study on the causes of death and disease published in the medical journal The Lancet. These estimates of the annual number of deaths dataset are shown here. The dataset is available from the Kaggle website: [Cause of Death - Our World In Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivanchvez/causes-of-death-our-world-in-data?resource=download).

1. Connect your data
2. Detect different data types in your data
3. Build at least 5 different visualizations to learn more about the dataset. 
4. This table has 36 different features. Can you detect the most important features ? Why do you think these are important? Can you define a question for yourself? Try to learn more about these categories and find appropriate numerical features to study different trends in them. In this dataset, every column has the same importance because it explains one of the conditions that leads to death. Your task is to identify the most important reasons of death (features) in all countries as well as within each country.
5. In your final project you should show visualizations with:
  - Maps
  - Date and time
  - Analytical visuals (Forecasting - Clustering)
  - Show Me tables
6. Try to find an interesting pattern, trend, outlier, etc. from the data used in the above steps.
7. From step 5, try to detect meaningful keypoints. This is the starting point to think about your dashboard. 
8. Now that you are familiar with your dataset and your columns, in this step, come up with different questions which you will be answering and presenting at the end of this project.
